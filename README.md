# PSO


The active suspension system was modeled as a dual mass-spring-damper with a controlled actuator. A Fuzzy Logic Controller for the actuator based on Mamdani inference and centroid defuzzification was built on MATLAB Simulink. The inputs to the controller were normalized using scaling factors that were optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm. The PSO optimized active suspension system showed improved performance for single perturbations (speed breakers) as well as continuously uneven roads over the passive suspension system. The entire project was implemented on MATLAB.
